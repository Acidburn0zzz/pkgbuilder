PKGBUILDer.  A Python AUR helper/library.
=========================================


.. note::
    This documentation is compatible with version |release| of
    PKGBUILDer.
    The current version on your system can be checked by running
    `pkgbuilder -v`.

PKGBUILDer is an AUR helper, i.e. an application which builds AUR
packages.  It can be used in conjunction with pacman (with a special
script).  It uses various techniques to automatize the process as
much as possible.

Since version 2.1.0, PKGBUILDer provides modules that can be used in
other scripts.

For standalone use, see the :doc:`PKGBUILDer man page <pkgbuilder>`.
Reading the appendices (:doc:`README` and
:doc:`Message codes <messagecodes>`) is also a good idea.

For python module usage, see the respective class documents.
